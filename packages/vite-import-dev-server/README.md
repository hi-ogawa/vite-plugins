# vite-import-dev-server

for some reason [`@vavite/expose-vite-dev-server`](https://github.com/cyco130/vavite/blob/3cf52a5bd25deadde0949a52be31af1ad04c36d8/packages/expose-vite-dev-server/readme.md) is not working, so this is a simplified version of it to make the same thing work.

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm release
```
